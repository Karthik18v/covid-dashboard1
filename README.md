# Covid-19 Dashboard

## Description
The **Covid-19 Dashboard** is a React-based application designed to provide updated and detailed information about the Covid-19 pandemic in India. The app fetches data from an internal server and displays key statistics about Covid-19 cases, including confirmed, active, recovered, and deceased cases, both for the country and for individual states and union territories. 

The app demonstrates the use of React class components, component lifecycle methods, routing, and responsiveness for an optimal user experience.

## Quick Tips
- To transform object items into an array for easier rendering, refer to [this example](https://codesandbox.io/s/conversion-of-object-items-to-array-items-vyy1s).
- Implement charts using the [Recharts documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recharts).
- For dropdown implementation, refer to the [React Select documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-select/v/2.4.3).

## Important Notes
- Use only the third-party libraries mentioned in the **Quick Tips** section.
- Do not use `styled-components` for styling. Instead, use plain CSS.
- Ensure all undefined case counts are set to `0`.
- Add `testid` attributes for testability in HTML elements, e.g., `<div testid="countryWideConfirmedCases" className="country-wide-confirmed-cases"/>`.
